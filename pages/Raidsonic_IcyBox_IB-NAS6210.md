# Raidsonic IcyBox IB-NAS6210
## info

The Raidsonic IcyBox IB-NAS6210 (and to some extent it's 2-bay sibling the IB-NAS6220) are very similar devices to the Stora. A few notable differences:

- Double the RAM of the Stora
- 1 drivebay
- Newer revision of the SoC
- Different customizations by Axxentra

However, there's a big catch:

- It is not under active support by Axxentra (This is not Axxentra's fault: Raidsonic never asked Axxentra to update the device and they probably never will because the userbase it too small)
- Because of this, without manual tinkering, the device is missing key features and functionality that the Stora do√©s have 'out of the box'
- Raidsonic, up till now, is unresponsive to inquiries on support of this active device
