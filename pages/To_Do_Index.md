- Design Prototype Design prototype board to make connection to JTAG simple and clean.
- Front-end Building a new front-end for the stora mark 2.
- Name Naming this project.
- Pin-outs Check MPP20 and MPP34 there can be only one!
- Migration Migrate rootfs to HDD? Maybe a better option if we are going to add lots of mods.
- Clocking Check to see if CPU is temperature monitored. Possible to overclock w/o overheating.
