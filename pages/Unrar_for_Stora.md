# Unrar for Stora
I just uploaded an ARM-compiled version of unrar, you should be able to use the binary out of the box on your original (but hacked) Stora firmware, just place it under /usr/local/bin or wherever you like.

It's under the Upload folder in the Remository, direct link: [here](http://www.hardwarehackersunite.com/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=58&func=fileinfo&id=27)

### Alternatively...

If you have installed the IPKG package manager you can install it by doing:
```
-bash-3.2$ sudo ipkg install unrar
```
